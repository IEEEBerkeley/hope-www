Project Design Review 
=====================

---------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Design Review Submission: Due at 10/30, 7:59pm 
---------------------------------------------------------

- Have a close-to-finalized schematic and layout ready before the design review. 

  #. *Print* out a **PDF of your schematic** by going to the Schematic layout editor and choosing File --> Plot... --> PDF --> Plot all sheets. 
      #. Do the same with your layout. It is ok if things are incomplete, bring as much as you can. 
  #. **Zip your project folder together.** This folder should include the <projectname>.pro, <projectname>.sch, and <projectname>.kicad_pcb files. 
     Add this zip as part of a new followup to your project post on Piazza, and make it clear what it is. 

- Have a semi-finalized BOM ready for the design review. 

  #. Copy the "HOPE Template BOM" from `here <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZZAnW61lbqi8A5PHymeQs3MktsaBvQEssZroThjktFo>`_. 

  #. Fill out the corresponding information in your BOM, and be sure to *follow* the instructions. 

  #. Print out a copy as well. 

- Upload your project zip as well as your BOM to your project Piazza post. Make it clear where it is (either in a new followup or in a visually
  designated section in the main post (aka make a "Pre-Design Review Submission" section). 

.. .. important:: 

..  Finally, fill out `this form <https://forms.gle/d9Ae71X3iJeSJe117>`_.

In-Class Design Review Instructions: 10/30
-------------------------------------------

- Pair up with another group. 

- Exchange BOM and schematics. This will be much easier if you have *hard-copies* ready for your partner group.

- Spend some time away from the other group and try to understand their project and schematic before meeting back up (~10 min.)

- Each group will have **30 minutes** to present their design. 
  The instructors will be dropping in during the review to answer questions and participate in the review. 

  .. attention:: 

      Your design reviews are *not* complete until an instructor has noted down that it is. If both groups have finished presenting
      by the time an instructor joins, summarize the reviews. It helps if notes, criticisms, and such were noted down on each 
      group's project *printouts*. 

- As the presenting group, it is your responsibility to answer any questions the reviewers may have about your design. You should also bring up any concerns you may have about your own design so that you can get a fresh perspective on the problem. You should approach the review in the following order: 
   
   #. Overview of what your board does, the big picture. Explain relevant standards and specifications. 
   #. Explain why you chose certain components
      - What component features led you to choose this specific part?
      - At this point look over component footprints, layout, and supporting schematic design. 
      - Make sure your design follows datasheet requirements. 
   #. Check mechanical requirements 
   #. **Take notes** of feedback on your printouts. 

- As the reviewing group, it is your responsibility to:
   #. Check/scrutinize the design of the presenting group. 
   #. Point out any concerns you may have. 
   #. Critique or ask questions about the design. 
   #. **Annotate** the printouts of the other group's design. 
   #. Make sure that the presenting group's design follows the `HOPE PCB Checklist <checklist.html>`_.
