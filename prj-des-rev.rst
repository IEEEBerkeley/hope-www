Project Design Review 
=====================

---------------------------------------------------------
Pre-Design Review Submission: Due before 4/3/19 at 8:20pm 
---------------------------------------------------------

- Have a semi-finalized schematic and layout ready before the design review. 

  #. Print out a **PDF of your schematic** by going to the Schematic layout editor and choosing File --> Plot... --> PDF --> Plot all sheets. 
  #. **Zip your project folder together.** This folder should include the <projectname>.pro, <projectname>.sch, and <projectname>.kicad_pcb files. 

- Have a semi-finalized BOM ready for the design review. 

  #. Copy the "HOPE Template BOM" from `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZAnW61lbqi8A5PHymeQs3MktsaBvQEssZroThjktFo/edit?usp=sharing>`_. 
  #. Rename your file to **"BOM Design Review FirstLastName1 FirstLastName2 FirstLastName3"**. Please be sure to replace the FirstLastName# with your name and only add names 2 and 3 if applicable. Fill out the corresponding information in your BOM, and be sure to follow the instructions.

.. important:: 

 Finally, fill out `this form <https://forms.gle/d9Ae71X3iJeSJe117>`_.

In-Class Design Review Instructions: 4/3/19
-------------------------------------------

- Pair up with another group. 

- Exchange BOM and schematic PDFs.

- Each group will have **45 minutes** to present their design. The instructors will be dropping in during the review to answer questions and participate in the review. 

   - As the presenting group, it is your responsibility to answer any questions the reviewers may have about your design. You should also bring up any concerns you may have about your own design so that you can get a fresh perspective on the problem. You should approach the review in the following order: 
    
      #. Overview of what your board does, the big picture. Explain relevant standards and specifications. 
      #. Explain why you chose certain components
         - What component features led you to choose this specific part?
         - At this point look over component footprints, layout, and supporting schematic design. 
         - Make sure your design follows datasheet requirements. 
      #. Check mechanical requirements 
 
   - As the reviewing group, it is your responsibility to:
      #. Check/scrutinize the design of the presenting group. 
      #. Point out any concerns you may have. 
      #. Critique or ask questions about the design. 
      #. Make sure that the presenting group's design follows the `HOPE PCB Checklist <checklist.html>`_.
