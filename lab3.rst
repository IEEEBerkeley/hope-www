Measurements and Ohm's Law
==========================

In this lab you will perform a series of measurements using the power supply
and digital multimeter. If you have questions about using the equipment,
please ask an instructor.

:math:`R_{series} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots`

:math:`R_{parallel} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R2} + \cdots}`

Measurements
============
Using the power supply, set a 5 V output with a 0.020 A current limit on the 6
V rails. Measure the following:

1. Current through a 300 Ohm resistor

2. In a series combination of 300 Ohms and 510 Ohms, the voltage across the 300
   Ohm resistor

3. Total current through a parallel combination of two 510 Ohm resistors. What
   is the equivalent resistance of this parallel combination?

4. Voltage and current across a 100 Ohm resistor. Is this what you expect?

5. Total current through the figure on the board. What is the voltage across
   points A and B? What answer did you expect?


Black Boxes
===========
1. Measure the current through Thing 2 (blue) with three different voltage
   inputs between 0 and 2 V. Does Thing 2 follow Ohm's Law?

2. Measure the current through Thing 3 (red) with three different voltage
   inputs between 0 and 2 V. Does Thing 3 follow Ohm's Law?


LEDs
====
Light emitting diodes (LEDs) are semiconductor devices that do not obey Ohm's
law. An LED is specified at 15 mA with a forward voltage of 2.2 V. If you
connect the LED backwards ("in reverse") it won't light up.

- If you connected the LED in forward bias to a 2.2 V source, what current
  would flow?

- What would happen if you connected an LED to a 5 V source?

- You want to build a LED flashlight that operates off a USB port (5 V).
  Design a circuit that safely powers one or more LEDs at this input voltage.

- Get your designed okayed by an instructor, build, and test it.
