==================
Project Submission
==================

#. Upload your design to `InstantDFM
   <http://instantdfm.bayareacircuits.com/>`_. Select 'Blue' soldermask and
   use default settings for the rest. When InstantDFM passes, send us your
   InstantDFM link.

#. Submit your BOM for a **single** board in **CSV format**. Your BOM must
   have the following columns, in order:

   1. Project group member emails (this should be the same for all rows)
   2. Reference designator (e.g. R1, C2, etc.)
   3. Quantity
   4. Description or value (e.g. "Resistor 1.5K 0603 5%")
   5. Manufacturer Part Number
   6. Digi-Key Part Number (leave blank if not applicable)
   7. Mouser Part Number (leave blank if not applicable)
   8. Purchase URL (applicable only if not from either Digi-Key or Mouser)
   9. Unit cost

   If your BOM contains additional columns, put them after column 9; we won't
   look at them.

   For **resistors only**, if you leave fields 5-8 blank, we will pick an
   appropriate resistor for you. If you do not indicate tolerance or package
   size, we will assume 5% 0603. *If you do not have special requirements for
   your resistors, please leave these fields blank to help us consolidate
   orders.*

#. Send us your InstantDFM link, BOM, and desired quantity of boards. We will
   tell you if you need to make changes and how many boards we think we can
   provide PCBs and parts for.

#. Multiply the quantity of each item in your BOM by the number of boards
   we're giving you, plus some extra, if applicable.

#. Email us your updated BOM.
