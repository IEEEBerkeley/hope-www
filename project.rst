Project Submission
==================

#. Per our sponsorship agreement with Bay Area Circuits, you should add their
   logo to your silkscreen. At your option, you may also include our IEEE
   student chapter's logo.

   - If you are using KiCad, download our footprints for the `two logos
     <https://tinyurl.com/hopelogos>`_.

     - Add the footprints into your KiCad footprint library by going to
       Footprint Editor → Preferences → Manage Footprint Libraries → Project
       Specific Tab → Browse Libraries → Locate the downloaded folder. 

     - Add these logos to your footprint by pressing 'O' and then finding the
       correct library and the correct components. 

   - If you are using Eagle, find the steps `here
     <https://www.instructables.com/id/Adding-Custom-Graphics-to-EAGLE-PCB-Layouts/>`_.
     You can find the bitmap logo files from this `link
     <https://tinyurl.com/hopelogosbitmap>`_.

#. Generate production files (all relevant Gerbers and drill files) and
   generate a ZIP file.

#. Upload your ZIP file to `InstantDFM
   <http://instantdfm.bayareacircuits.com/>`_. Select 'Blue' soldermask and
   use default settings for the rest. Make sure your design passes InstantDFM.
   Save your InstantDFM link; you'll need to send it to us.

#. Prepare your BOM for a **single** board in using the `template <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZAnW61lbqi8A5PHymeQs3MktsaBvQEssZroThjktFo/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

   For **resistors only**, if you leave the Digi-Key and Mouser part numbers
   blank, we will pick an appropriate resistor for you based on your part
   description. If you do not indicate tolerance or package size, **we will
   assume 5% 0805**. *If you do not have special requirements for your
   resistors, please leave these fields blank to help us consolidate orders.*

#. Submit your final design using `the project submission form <https://forms.gle/443SBpfo9BnLmNF19>`_.
