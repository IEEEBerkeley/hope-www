==================
Project Submission
==================

#. Per our sponsorship agreement with Bay Area Circuits, you should add their
   logo to your silkscreen. At your option, you may also include our IEEE
   student chapter's logo.

   - If you are using KiCad, download our footprints for the `two logos
     <https://tinyurl.com/hopelogos>`_.

     - Add the footprints into your KiCad footprint library by going to
       Footprint Editor → Preferences → Manage Footprint Libraries → Project
       Specific Tab → Browse Libraries → Locate the downloaded folder. 

     - Add these logos to your footprint by pressing 'O' and then finding the
       correct library and the correct components. 

     You can also add your own images/logos to your silkscreen (or even other layers, if 
     you're feeling spicy) using KiCad's 'Bitmap to Component Converter', located in the 
     main applications toolbar in the project window. Try it yourself with the IEEE 
     and BAC logos Bitmap files from this `link
     <https://tinyurl.com/hopelogosbitmap>`_. 

#. Generate production files (all relevant Gerbers and drill files) and
   put them all into a ZIP file.

#. Upload your ZIP file to `InstantDFM
   <http://instantdfm.bayareacircuits.com/>`_. Select 'Blue' soldermask and
   use default settings for the rest. Make sure your design passes InstantDFM.
   Save your InstantDFM *link*; you'll need to send it to us.

#. Prepare your BOM for a **single** board in using the `template <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZZAnW61lbqi8A5PHymeQs3MktsaBvQEssZroThjktFo>`_.

   For **resistors only**, if you leave the Digi-Key and Mouser part numbers
   blank, we will pick an appropriate resistor for you based on your part
   description. If you do not indicate tolerance or package size, **we will
   assume 5% 0805**. *If you do not have special requirements for your
   resistors, please leave these fields blank to help us consolidate orders.*

.. #. Submit your final design using `the project submission form <https://forms.gle/443SBpfo9BnLmNF19>`_.

#. Final Design submission instructions coming soon... Due **11/6** at **6pm**.
