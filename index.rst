This course is a whirlwind introduction to building useful things with
electronics. Students will learn basic electronic theory, understand and
draw schematics, prototype and troubleshoot using lab equipment, and apply
their knowledge on a project of their choice.

There will be an emphasis on building sensor circuits with microcontrollers.
Students are not expected to have any background in electrical engineering.

Policies
========

Enrollment
----------
We will do our best to accommodate all students who come to the first week
of class. Students who wish to enroll past the second week of class should
first contact the course facilitators for approval.

Course Format
-------------
This course spans 13 weeks, with two hours of lecture and lab plus an
additional hour of individual preparation per week. Students are expected to
spend six hours outside of class to complete their final project. This is a
total of 45 hours over the semester.

Each class begins with a short lecture followed by a hands-on lab. Each lab
builds on previous weeks' labs. All equipment and materials will be
provided. Computers will be used during lab. Students may bring their own
laptops or use lab computers (instructional account provided).

The final project is intended to apply the concepts learned in the class to
a practical or fun project that can be reasonably completed within a few
weeks. The facilitators will help out with the completion of the projects as
much as possible.

Attendance
----------
You may miss up to three classes unexcused. If you miss a class, you may
need to make up the missed lab before the next lecture. Contact the
instructors to see if make-up is required.

Each additional absence may result in a 10-point deduction from your
attendance score. Excessive absence may result in a NP.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on attendance and effort in class.
Participation and completion of labs is strongly advised.

Attendance: 60 points

Final Project: 20 points
    The final project is graded on effort and a demonstration or description
    of your work.

Decorum and Effort: 20%
    Decorum and Effort is based on behavior in class, participation and
    observance of safety instructions.

Students need at least 60 points to pass.


FAQ
===
*I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?*

Yes. You will be given the CCN during the second week of class. Please check
the course web page and fill out the first week sign-in.
