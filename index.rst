This course is a whirlwind introduction to building useful things with
electronics. Students will learn basic electronic theory, understand and
draw schematics, prototype and troubleshoot using lab equipment, and apply
their knowledge on a project of their choice.

There will be an emphasis on building sensor circuits with microcontrollers.
Students are not expected to have any background in electrical engineering.

Policies
========

Enrollment
----------
Enrollment is limited to 40 students on a first-come basis and will be
finalized during the third week of class. Priority will be given to students
who consistently attend class.

Course Format
-------------
This course spans 13 weeks, with two hours of lecture and lab plus an
additional hour of individual preparation per week. Students are expected to
spend six hours outside of class to complete their final project. This is a
total of 45 hours over the semester.

Each class begins with a short lecture followed by a hands-on lab. Each lab
builds on previous weeks' labs. All equipment and materials will be
provided. Computers will be used during lab. Students may bring their own
laptops or use lab computers with a provided EECS instructional account.

The final project is intended to apply the concepts learned in the class to
a practical or fun project that can be reasonably completed within a few
weeks.

Attendance
----------
You may miss up to three classes unexcused. If you miss a class, you may
need to make up the missed lab before the next lecture. Contact the
instructors to see if make-up is required.

Additional, excessive absence may result in a NP.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs in class.  The final
project is graded on effort and a demonstration or description of your work.
Students need 60% to pass.

- Labs: 70%
- Project: 30%


FAQ
===
*I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?*

Yes. You will be given the CCN during the second week of class. Please check
the course web page and fill out the first week sign-in.

*I missed more classes and still want to enroll.*

Fill out the first week sign-in to receive the CCN. Please review the
`attendance`_ policy.
