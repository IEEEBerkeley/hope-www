This course is a whirlwind introduction to building useful things with
electronics. Students will learn basic electronic theory, understand and
draw schematics, prototype and troubleshoot using lab equipment, and apply
their knowledge on a project of their choice.

There will be an emphasis on building sensor circuits with microcontrollers.
Students are not expected to have any background in electrical engineering.

Course Format
=============
This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Students
are expected to spend an hour a week outside of class reviewing material and
preparing for class meetings. Final projects are expected to take up to six
hours outside of class in all.

Each class begins with a short lecture followed by a lab activity. Some labs
build on previous weeks' labs. All equipment and materials will be provided.
Computers will be used during lab; students may bring their own laptops or
use lab computers with provided EECS instructional accounts.

The final project is intended to apply the concepts learned in the class to
a practical or fun project that can be reasonably completed within a few
weeks.

Enrollment
----------
CCNs are given out during the first week of class. Enrollment will be
finalized during the third week of class. Priority will be given to students
who consistently attend class.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs in class. The final
project is graded on effort and a demonstration or description of your work.
Students need 60% to pass.

- Labs: 70%
- Project: 30%

Attendance
----------
Since grading is primarily based on completion of labs during class,
students should make a best effort to attend class.

You may miss up to two labs unexcused; no instructor approval is required.
If you miss a class, you may need to make up the missed lab before the next
lecture. Labs that require make-up are labeled on the `Timeline`_.

Additional unexcused absences may result in a NP.


FAQ
===
*I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?*

Yes. You will be given the CCN during the second week of class.
