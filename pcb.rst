Overview
========
EE 198: Hands-On PCB Engineering is an introductory course to printed circuit board
(PCB) design and layout practices and concerns. It is intended for students with
some experience with circuits who are interested in learning about and gaining or
improving PCB design and assembly skills, and particularly those who are part of or
intend to join engineering student organizations with working knowledge in PCB design.

Prerequisites
-------------
EE 16A or similar working knowledge in circuits. 
Come to class **with a computer mouse** and KiCAD installed. **This includes the first
class.**

Objective
---------
Students will learn effective system, schematic, and layout design through hands-on
applications and will be exposed to various advanced concerns such as DFx, grounding,
decoupling, EMC/EMI, and thermal management. 

**Please note that...**

This PCB design course's primary objective is not to teach students how to 
come up with their own circuits. Rather, it is to provide a formal and 
guided path to the design process of PCBs, which does involve but is not
exclusively circuit design. 

Timeline
========
Our first class for Spring 2020 is **Wednesday, January 29th**. 

For alternative or in-depth treatment of topics discussed in class, see
`Supplemental Reading`_.

.. note::
   Keep in mind that the following schedule is still tentative and subject to (small) changes.

Course Format
=============
This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each class
begins with a short lecture followed by a practical assignment (lab activity). 
Labs and assignments can be completed in pairs and build on those from previous weeks. Students
are expected to spend an hour a week outside of class reviewing material,
preparing for class meetings, and completing assignments.

Students are required to complete a final project: a complete PCB design and
assembly. Students may choose to design a PCB for an engineering student
organization, class project, or another design of their choice, with instructor approval.

Materials
---------
Students should bring to class a laptop computer or similar device capable of
running the following software:

- `KiCad 5 <http://kicad-pcb.org/download/>`_

If you have difficulty obtaining the required course materials, please
contact_ the instructors.

Enrollment
----------
CCNs are given out during the first week of class. Enrollment will be finalized during the third week of class.
Priority will be given to students who consistently attend class.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs and assignments. The final
project is graded on effort and a demonstration of concepts taught in the
course. More details about project grading will be released by the second week of class. 
Students need 70% to pass.

- Labs/Assignments: 50%
- Participation: 15%
- Project: 35%

Attendance
----------
Since the completion of labs in class contributes the most to class grade,
students should try their best to attend class. Please let instructors know of
absenses beforehand, if possible.

FAQ
===
**I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?**

  Yes. You will be given the CCN when you come to the second week of class.
  Keep in mind that we may not have enough seats for you to enroll, and that
  you will be joining the class with one absence.
