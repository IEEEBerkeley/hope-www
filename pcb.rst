Overview
========
This course introduces printed circuit board (PCB) design and layout practices
and concerns. It is intended for students with some experience with circuits
who are interested in learning or improving their PCB design and fabrication
skills, and particularly those who are part of or intend to join engineering
student organizations with working knowledge in PCB design.

Prerequisites
-------------
EE 16A or similar working knowledge in circuits
We strongly suggest coming to class with a computer mouse and KiCAD installed. 

Objective
---------
Students learn effective system, schematic, and layout design through hands-on
applications and exposure to advanced concerns including DFT, DFM, grounding,
decoupling, EMC/EMI, thermals, isolation.


Timeline
========
Our first class for Fall 2019 is **Wednesday, September 4th**. *This schedule
is tentative and may change at instructor discretion.* 

For alternative or in-depth treatment of topics discussed in class, see

Course Format
=============
This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each class
begins with a short lecture followed by a practical assignment (lab activity). 
Labs and assignments can be completed in pairs and build on those from previous weeks. Students
are expected to spend an hour a week outside of class reviewing material,
preparing for class meetings, and completing assignments.

Students are required to complete a final project: a complete PCB design and
assembly. Students may choose to design a PCB for an engineering student
organization, class project, or another design of their choice, with instructor approval.
Final projects are expected to take up to six hours of additional time outside
of class.

Materials
---------
Students should bring to class a laptop computer or similar device capable of
running the following software:

- `KiCad 5 <http://kicad-pcb.org/download/>`_

If you have difficulty obtaining the required course materials, please
contact_ the instructors.

Enrollment
----------
CCNs are given out during the first week of class. Enrollment will be finalized during the third week of class.
Priority will be given to students who consistently attend class.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs and assignments. The final
project is graded on effort and a demonstration of concepts taught in the
course. Students need 70% to pass.

- Labs/Assignments: 50%
- Participation: 20%
- Project: 30%

Labs are graded based on completing a successful checkoff. We encourage you to review your designs with peers 
because each student will have only 2 attempts at a checkoff for each lab. 

Attendance
----------
Since grading is primarily based on completion of labs during class,
students should make a best effort to attend class.

Absences must be excused to prevent it from affecting your grade. One unexcused absence will be permitted. 

.. If you miss a class (with notification), you *must make up the missed lab or assignment by the
.. next lecture for the absence to be considered excused. Please also read over the lecture slides 
.. from the class you missed.

Additional unexcused absences may result in a NP.

FAQ
===
**I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?**

  Yes. You will be given the CCN when you come to the second week of class.
  Keep in mind that we may not have enough seats for you to enroll, and that
  you will be joining the class with one absence.
