Most of the lab components for today will compose of lighting up LED's and familiarizing yourself with writing simple C code. For those with limited programming experience, worry not! Most of the code that we'll be modifying / tweaking today will require some pattern recognition skills on your part, but not necessarily coding experience."

This LED won't look like the LED's that we've been using in class because it's part of a class of components called Surface-Mount Devices (SMD).

The default Blink.ino sketch blinks the LED with a <b>period</b> of 2 seconds and a <b>duty cycle</b> of 50%. This means that an entire cycle takes 2 seconds and that the LED is on for 50% of the time, and off for 50% of the time.\n",

    "2. Let's change the blinking rhythm! Modify your code so that it blinks with a period of 1 second and a duty cycle of 75%. (on for 75% of the time, off for 25% of the time) Upload and verify that your code behaves as expected.\n",
