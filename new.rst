This course discusses advanced printed circuit board (PCB) design and layout
practices and concerns. It is intended for students who are part of or intend
to join engineering student organizations with working knowledge in PCB
design.

Students learn layout through hands-on experience with grounding, decoupling,
EMC/EMI, and DFM. Students then design actual building blocks after learning
design patterns, key specifications, part selection, and DFT.

Course Format
=============
This course spans 13 weeks. Class meets for two hours once a week. Each
class begins with a short lecture followed by a lab activity. Some labs
build on previous weeks' labs. Students are expected to spend an hour a week
outside of class reviewing material and preparing for class meetings.

The final project is intended to apply the concepts learned in the class to
a practical or fun project that can be reasonably completed within a few
weeks. Final projects are expected to take up to six hours of additional
time outside of class.

Materials
---------
All equipment and materials will be provided. Computers will be used during
lab; students may bring their own laptops or use lab computers with their
`EECS instructional accounts <http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/webacct/>`_.

Enrollment
----------
CCNs are given out during the first week of class. Enrollment will be
finalized during the third week of class. Priority will be given to students
who consistently attend class.

Grading
-------
Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs in class. The final
project is graded on effort and a demonstration or description of your work.
Students need 60% to pass.

- Labs: 70%
- Project: 30%

Attendance
----------
Since grading is primarily based on completion of labs during class,
students should make a best effort to attend class.

You may miss up to two labs unexcused; no instructor approval is required.
If you miss a class, you may need to make up the missed lab before the next
lecture. Labs that require make-up are labeled on the `Timeline`_.

Additional unexcused absences may result in a NP.


FAQ
===
*I missed the first class. Can I still enroll?*

Yes. You will be given the CCN when you come to the second week of class. Keep
in mind that we may not have enough seats for you to enroll, and that you will
be joining the class with one absence.
